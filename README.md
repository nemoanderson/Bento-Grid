## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Grid.
Easier than flex
fr units only in grid. I seen these in YT tutorials and my lazy brain just skip over the usage of it but I see how they are beneficial.

Grid column
span

Keep it simple:
use rows only if needed
same with line numbers, keep it simple add complexity when needed.
First: you have to display:grid;
Second: gap: ;
Thrid: grid-template-colums: ;
Forth: span

Picture tag.

### Continued development

#### Issues with Sync to GitHub

What is happening is creating several version of the same project instead of fixing bugs. This has made create more problems when coming back to refactor code. Lesson to be learn. To fix this I'm archiving previous versions and cloning the Repository from GitHub. I've been editing in GitHub but this seems it will also cause issue so, editing in my code editor is so much better. 

#### Improve code

We have to start with Google font error in Lighthouse under performance. Error is Render-blocking requests; When search error, I learn that it's when CSS and JavaScript files—loaded in the <head> of a webpage that prevent the browser from rendering content until they are fully downloaded, parsed, and executed.  This delays key performance metrics like First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), negatively impacting user experience and SEO.
