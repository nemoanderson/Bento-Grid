## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Grid.
Easier than flex
fr units only in grid. I seen these in YT tutorials and my lazy brain just skip over the usage of it but I see how they are beneficial.

Grid column
span

Keep it simple:
use rows only if needed
same with line numbers, keep it simple add complexity when needed.
First: you have to display:grid;
Second: gap: ;
Thrid: grid-template-colums: ;
Forth: span

Picture tag.
